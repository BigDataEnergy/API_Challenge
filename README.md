## OpenWeatherMap API Challenge

In this exercise, I created a python script to query the OpenWeatherMap API 500 times in order to get a sample of random locations around the world. The API was then used to gather data on each city, such as average temperature, wind speeds, etc. Plotly was used to visualize the findings and identify any possible trends. 

The second part took the results from the first and filterd them to the user's prefernces. The program then took the remaining cities and used the Google Maps API to find the closest hotels in the areas.
